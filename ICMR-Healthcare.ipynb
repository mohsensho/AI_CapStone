This would lead us to early identification of each type of cancer reducing the fatality rate.\n","\n","### Dataset Details: \n","\n","The input dataset contains 802 samples for the corresponding 802 people who have been detected with different types of cancer.

This is an example of how the deep neural network works. Creative and analytical components of information are analyzed and grouped to ensure that the object is identified correctly. These components are not brought to the system directly, thus the ML system has to modify and derive them.

Usually this is applied element-wise to the output of some other function, such as a matrix-vector product. In MLP usages, rectifier units replace all other activation functions except perhaps the readout layer. But I suppose you could mix-and-match them if you'd like. One way ReLUs improve neural networks is by speeding up training. The gradient computation is very simple (either 0 or 1 depending on the sign of x). Also, the computational step of a ReLU is easy: any negative elements are set to 0.0 -- no exponentials, no multiplication or division operations. Gradients of logistic and hyperbolic tangent networks are smaller than the positive portion of the ReLU. This means that the positive portion is updated more rapidly as training progresses. However, this comes at a cost. The 0 gradient on the left-hand side is has its own problem, called \"dead neurons,\" in which a gradient update sets the incoming values to a ReLU such that the output is always zero; modified ReLU units such as ELU (or Leaky ReLU etc.) can minimize this.
